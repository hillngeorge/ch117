                <h3>Field Service Electrician, Veteran</h3>
                <p>
                    My name is George Dick. I'm an Iraq war veteran who served in the army from 2006 to 2010. I was a forward observer and served in Baghdad, Iraq from 2007 to the end of 2009. I have a daughter and a son, and I've been married for 17 years. I love to fish and hunt, and my favorite pastime is music. I play guitar, bass, and some drums. Currently, I'm a field service electrician for Parkline. I live in Dickinson, TX.
